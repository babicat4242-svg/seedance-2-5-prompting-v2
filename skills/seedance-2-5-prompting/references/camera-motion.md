Camera wording is a **prompting vocabulary and compiler heuristic**, not a promise of a dedicated camera control or frame-perfect reproduction. Follow the capability qualifications in [model-differences.md](model-differences.md): the visible interface and uploaded references determine what is selectable or enforceable.

## Camera instruction schema

Use one ordered clause chain for each beat:

```text
purpose → start framing → primary move → path/direction → speed profile
→ subject blocking → lens/focus → end framing → continuity/edit
```

For 2.5, apply the [shot-writing rules](seedance-25-writing-rules.md): render focal length and LOCKED OFF or the primary move early in the CAMERA clause, and keep a continuous shot on the same primary route and focal length by default. Intentional zooms and explicitly requested, physically connected phases remain valid.

Name one dominant move before adding a secondary move. Describe a beat's contiguous start state and end state; time ranges, degrees, focal lengths, and speeds are intent cues unless an available control or path reference makes them enforceable. For longer scenes, 6–8 second beats are a useful heuristic, not a timing guarantee.

## Translation moves

### Push / dolly in

## Lens and focus behavior

### Optical zoom

- **Physical change:** Focal length changes without translating the camera body; perspective position remains fixed.
- **Required fields:** Fixed camera position; zoom direction; target; speed; end framing.
- **Stable relationship:** Subject size changes through optical compression while parallax does not indicate camera travel.
- **Compatible with:** Locked body position, tripod pan/tilt, rack focus.
- **Conflicts with:** A dolly request unless the special effect is intentional.
- **Seedance-ready phrase:** `Keep camera position fixed; optical zoom in on the actor’s hands, minimal parallax change, finish tight on the key.`

### Dolly zoom

- **Physical change:** Camera translation and opposite optical zoom combine to hold subject size while background perspective changes.
- **Required fields:** Dolly direction; inverse zoom direction; subject size lock as intent; target; end framing.
- **Stable relationship:** State that the subject remains approximately the same screen size while the background expands or compresses.

### Fixed focus / target lock

- **Physical change:** Focus remains assigned to one target or depth plane while motion continues.
- **Required fields:** Focus target; target movement allowance; camera path; fallback if occluded; end focus.
- **Stable relationship:** Keep the named target sharp as practical; do not imply guaranteed pixel-perfect lock.
- **Compatible with:** Tracking, orbit, gimbal, rack focus entering or leaving the lock.
- **Conflicts with:** A simultaneous rack focus to another target; abrupt depth-plane changes without a transition.
- **Seedance-ready phrase:** `Track beside the dancer with fixed focus on her eyes; if a passerby occludes her, recover focus on her face as she clears frame.`

### Depth-of-field transition

- **Physical change:** The amount or placement of apparent sharpness changes, often with focus, lens, or staging.
- **Required fields:** Initial sharp plane; final sharp plane/look; subject blocking; camera motion; end emphasis.
- **Stable relationship:** Identify which story element gains or loses attention rather than treating blur as random decoration.
- **Compatible with:** Rack focus, push-in, optical zoom.
- **Conflicts with:** Simultaneous demand for deep focus across all planes unless explicitly staged.
- **Seedance-ready phrase:** `Begin with the foreground flowers soft and the couple sharp; transition attention to the flowers as the couple recedes, end with flowers in focus.`

## Rig and operator behavior

### Locked-off

- **Physical change:** No camera position, orientation, or focal-length change, and no deliberate operator drift.
- **Required fields:** Fixed framing; subject blocking; focus rule; allowed edit point; end framing.
- **Stable relationship:** The frame stays stable while action enters, exits, or changes within it.
- **Compatible with:** Rack focus, static staging, and subject action within the fixed frame.
- **Hard-lock wording:** State stable position/orientation/focal length first, then enumerate relevant alternative translations, rotations, zooms, and rig drift once when the lock is critical or needs repair. Keep focus, playback speed, and editing in separate constraints; locked-off alone does not forbid requested rack focus or slow-motion playback. See the [positive-first camera example](seedance-25-writing-rules.md).
- **Conflicts with:** Orbit, pan, tilt, truck, pedestal, crane, handheld, gimbal drift, and optical zoom; describe optical zoom as a separate fixed-position optical-zoom shot, not locked-off.
- **Seedance-ready phrase:** `Locked-off wide shot of the doorway; actors cross within the frame, fixed focus on the threshold, no camera movement, cut only after they exit.`

### Tripod pan / tilt

- **Physical change:** A fixed-position tripod supports controlled horizontal pan and/or vertical tilt.
- **Required fields:** Fixed position; rotation axis; start target; end target; settle.
- **Stable relationship:** The body remains in place and the horizon remains stable unless roll is separately requested.
- **Compatible with:** Optical zoom, rack focus, static staging.
- **Conflicts with:** Translation described as if it were tripod rotation; handheld shake.
- **Seedance-ready phrase:** `Tripod pan left, then tilt down from the clock to the actor’s hands; fixed camera position and a clean settled end.`

### Gimbal

- **Physical change:** Stabilized operator or rig translation/rotation follows a named route with smooth horizon behavior.
- **Required fields:** Dominant path; target relation; stabilization character; clearance; end framing.
- **Stable relationship:** Preserve a smooth, deliberate path rather than floating without motivation.
- **Compatible with:** Lead/follow/side tracking, orbit, pedestal, controlled micro-drift.
- **Conflicts with:** Locked-off; chaotic handheld; exact route without a path reference or landmarks.
- **Seedance-ready phrase:** `Smooth gimbal follow behind the actor through the lobby, stable horizon, clear the columns, finish at the elevator doors.`

### Controlled handheld

- **Physical change:** Operator-carried camera has restrained, purposeful micro-drift over a dominant path.
- **Required fields:** Dominant path; intensity qualifier; subject relation; stable horizon rule; end settle.
- **Stable relationship:** The framing remains readable and path-led; motion is not random shake.
- **Compatible with:** Follow tracking, lead tracking, fixed focus, brief whip pan.
- **Conflicts with:** Locked-off; exact reference path unless micro-drift is explicitly layered; chaotic shake.
- **Seedance-ready phrase:** `Controlled handheld follow, restrained micro-drift over a clear forward path, keep the actor’s face readable, settle before the final line.`

### Shoulder camera

- **Physical change:** Shoulder-mounted operator movement carries human-weight sway and responsive reframing.
- **Required fields:** Dominant path; proximity; sway restraint; subject blocking; end framing.
- **Stable relationship:** Retain readable composition and an intentional operator response to action.
- **Compatible with:** Documentary follow tracking, controlled handheld, rack focus.
- **Conflicts with:** Locked-off; precision white-model path treated as rigid; perfectly frictionless gimbal language.
- **Seedance-ready phrase:** `Shoulder camera stays close beside the speaker, subtle human sway but readable framing, reframe to the listener, settle at the exchange end.`

## Transition moves

### Hard cut

- **Physical change:** No continuous camera movement is implied across the edit; the shot changes at a named point.
- **Required fields:** Outgoing end frame; cut trigger; incoming start frame; continuity relationship; audio intent.
- **Stable relationship:** Preserve only the stated match element, such as gaze, motion direction, or sound.
- **Compatible with:** Any settled shot; match cut; whip-pan cut destination.
- **Conflicts with:** A one-shot requirement; an unnamed cut that reads as accidental.
- **Seedance-ready phrase:** `Hold the close-up until the door slams, then hard cut to the exterior wide with the slam continuing in audio.`

### Match cut

- **Physical change:** Two shots cut by matching a specified shape, action, orientation, or composition.
- **Required fields:** Outgoing match element; incoming match element; cut point; intentional difference; continuity rule.
- **Stable relationship:** Name what matches so the edit is not mistaken for a continuous camera path.
- **Compatible with:** Hard cut, graphic transition, repeated subject pose.
- **Conflicts with:** One-shot requirement; vague `match` with no shared element.
- **Seedance-ready phrase:** `Match cut from the round cup seen from above to the full moon in the same centered circular framing.`

### Whip-pan transition

- **Physical change:** A settled start rotates rapidly with intentional blur, then reaches a settled end or an explicit cut destination.
- **Required fields:** Settled start; rotational direction; blur interval; settled end or cut destination; readable-action placement.
- **Stable relationship:** A whip pan requires a settled start, rapid rotational blur, and a settled end or explicit cut destination.
- **Compatible with:** Tripod pan, controlled handheld, hard cut at the blur peak.
- **Conflicts with:** Long readable action during the blur; undefined destination; locked-off.
- **Seedance-ready phrase:** `Settle on the actor’s reaction, whip pan right into brief motion blur, then settle on the arriving car; keep readable action before and after the whip.`

### Occlusion wipe

- **Physical change:** A foreground object or darkness intentionally covers the lens/frame and reveals the next view.
- **Required fields:** Occluding object; entry direction; full-cover moment; reveal target; continuity/edit rule.
- **Stable relationship:** The occluder must be physically motivated by the path or subject blocking.
- **Compatible with:** Follow tracking, doorway handoff, match cut, white-model clearance reference.
- **Conflicts with:** A promised uninterrupted readable view; unaddressed geometry collision.
- **Seedance-ready phrase:** `Follow the actor until a passing coat fills the frame as an occlusion wipe; reveal the actor entering the next room on the same walking direction.`

### Dissolve

- **Physical change:** Two images overlap over a deliberate edit interval; it is not continuous physical camera travel.
- **Required fields:** Outgoing held frame; incoming start frame; shared motif; dissolve purpose; final settled frame.
- **Stable relationship:** Declare the visual or temporal link between layers and where the dissolve ends.
- **Compatible with:** Locked-off frames, slow pushes, memory/time transition.
- **Conflicts with:** One-shot requirement; rapid readable action that must stay unambiguous.
- **Seedance-ready phrase:** `Hold the empty chair, dissolve into the same chair at sunrise, end on the new wide frame with no implied camera teleport.`

## Combination rules

- Assign body translation, aim rotation, lens behavior, focus behavior, and subject blocking to separate clauses. Example: `truck camera left; pan right to retain the actor; rack focus from sign to face` is clearer than `move left around actor.`
- Choose one primary move per beat. Add a secondary move only when it has a distinct job and independent required fields.
- Use `dolly` when perspective/parallax should change. Use `optical zoom` when focal-length change from a fixed position is intended. Use a `dolly zoom` only when opposite movements intentionally preserve apparent subject size.
- Describe clockwise/counterclockwise orbit from the camera's view and name whether the subject is stationary, walking, or spinning independently.
- Treat a turntable as subject rotation: `subject rotates on turntable; camera remains fixed`—never substitute it for an orbit.
- Keep rack focus separate from motion: it changes focus target, not camera position or aim.
- For a continuous scene, place a readable action in settled portions of the beat; reserve a whip-pan blur for an intentional transition or explicitly state its cut destination.
- For one-shot work, say `one continuous shot; no cuts` and use only physically contiguous paths. For edits, name every allowed cut point and its matching continuity element.

## Conflict matrix

| Pair | Verdict | Repair |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Locked-off + orbit | Conflict | Choose locked framing or an orbit beat, not both. |
| Pan + lateral tracking | Distinct; combine only deliberately | Name camera translation and pan target separately. |
| Tilt + crane rise | Compatible when motivated | State rising path and independent aim behavior. |
| Push-in + zoom-in | Usually redundant | Choose dolly for parallax or zoom for optical compression. |
| Dolly-in + zoom-out | Compatible special effect | State subject size remains stable and background perspective changes. |
| Orbit + subject spin | High ambiguity | Assign camera orbit and subject rotation separately with directions. |
| Handheld + exact reference path | Risky | Use controlled micro-drift layered over the reference path or omit handheld. |
| Whip pan + long readable action | Conflict in the blur interval | Put readable action before or after the whip. |
| Rack focus + fixed focus on another target | Conflict | Choose the focus handoff or retain a single target lock. |
| Pan + truck with one direction word | Ambiguous | State `truck camera left; pan right to keep target framed`, with separate targets if needed. |
| Tilt + pedestal/crane described as one move | Ambiguous | State body height path and vertical aim behavior independently. |
| Orbit + locked horizon + roll | Conditional | Keep the horizon level or name a deliberate roll as a separate effect. |

## Reference-driven camera paths

### Priority order

1. Clean white-model/previs or camera-path video.
2. Start/end frames plus path prose.
3. Timestamped camera prose.
4. Generic camera keywords.

Use this as priority for camera-path evidence, while retaining the overall reference hierarchy in [model-differences.md](model-differences.md). Preserve each visible UI reference tag exactly. A reference gives strong directional evidence, not a guarantee of literal path, timing, camera settings, or collision behavior.

### Split path and actor instructions

Write separate clauses whenever both are present:

- **Camera-path reference clause:** identify the reference tag; state its source role; specify camera geometry/path/framing to transfer; state allowable visual replacements.
- **Actor-motion reference clause:** identify the reference tag; state performer/body action, pace, interaction, and what must not be inherited as camera motion.

Example: `Camera path: [PATH_TAG] is a white-model reference for the gimbal route only—preserve its doorway approach, left turn, and final wide framing; replace all materials, people, and lighting. Actor motion: [ACTOR_TAG] supplies the dancer's arm sequence only; do not inherit its camera movement.`

### White-model transfer fields

For any white-model/previs reference, write all six fields:

| Field | Direction to supply |
| --- | --- |
| Source role | Identify it as white-model/previs or camera-path video, and name the exact UI tag. |
| Geometry to preserve | Name spatial anchors such as doorway, corridor, stairs, furniture, elevation, and left/right turn. |
| Path to preserve | Give a contiguous camera route, start state, landmarks, movement direction, and end state. |
| Allowable visual replacement | State what may change: materials, lighting, characters, style, set dressing, or environment. |
| Collision handling | State clearance, camera handoff, occlusion, or route adjustment at doors, walls, stairs, and narrow passages. |
| Final framing | Name the final shot size, target placement, focus, horizon/angle if material, and whether to settle or cut. |

If camera and actor references disagree, say which governs each dimension rather than asking for an impossible blend. Narrowly revise the failing beat or reference assignment before changing unrelated direction.

## Failure diagnosis

| Symptom | Likely ambiguity | Repair |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Unwanted cut | Continuity was not selected or permitted cuts were not named. | Explicitly select `one continuous shot; no cuts`, or name allowed cut points with outgoing/incoming frames. |
| Subject leaves frame | No tracking relationship, end framing, or source headroom was specified. | State camera-to-subject relationship, end framing, and source headroom/lead room. |
| Orbit becomes subject spin | The moving agent and rotation directions were unassigned. | State `camera moves around a stationary/independently moving subject`; assign camera orbit and subject rotation separately. |
| Dolly looks like zoom | Physical body travel and parallax were omitted. | State physical camera travel and the expected foreground/background parallax. |
| Camera path jumps | Beats lack contiguous start/end states or the path evidence is weak. | Give contiguous start/end states per beat, or use a clean path reference. |
| Handheld becomes chaotic | Shake was requested without a dominant route or restraint. | Request restrained micro-drift and retain a dominant path. |
| Door/wall collision | Geometry, clearance, or the shot handoff was unspecified. | Use white-model geometry or describe clearance and camera handoff. |
| Late drift in 30s | Later beats have no resolved targets. | Allocate 6–8s beats and give every beat an end state; this is a heuristic, not a duration guarantee. |

## Community vocabulary cross-check

The community guide [awesome-seedance-2.5-api-prompts](https://github.com/Anil-matcha/awesome-seedance-2.5-api-prompts) independently uses common terms such as slow push in/dolly in, dolly out, tracking shot, crane up, steadicam follow, orbit, whip pan, locked off, top-down, handheld, gimbal, rack focus, and FPV continuous long take. Treat this only as a vocabulary cross-check, not proof of dedicated Seedance controls. See [community-api-prompts-analysis.md](community-api-prompts-analysis.md) for provenance and exclusions.

Normalize those short keywords through this reference before drafting: decide whether the camera body translates, the aim rotates, the lens changes, or focus moves; then add start framing, physical route, direction, speed, subject relation, end framing, and settle/cut behavior. For example, expand a bare tracking shot left into either side tracking or truck-left plus a separately named pan target. Expand rack focus with near target, far target, transfer order, and final focus target. Expand orbit with target, camera-relative direction, arc intent, radius, and end angle.

Do not copy a camera-word list into the prompt. Select one dominant move per beat, express the physical behavior, and reject conflicts using the matrix above.
